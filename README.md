Weather Journal App

Project 3 - Weather Journal App (Front End Developer Udacity Nanodegree)
Technology used: HTML, CSS, Javascript

Project Objective

The goal of this project is to utilize Web APIs and asynchronous code to develop a web application that leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data based on the user's location and dynamically update the user interface.

Setup
To set up the project and get it up and running, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that Node.js and the required packages (express, cors, and body-parser) are installed. These packages are necessary for creating the server.

2. After confirming the setup, start the server by running the command `node server.js` in the terminal.

Development Process

* Begin by setting up the project environment and ensuring that Node.js and the required packages are properly installed and included in the server.js file.
* Implement POST and GET routes to ensure accurate retrieval of data from the server.
* Obtain API credentials from the OpenWeatherMap website.
* Create asynchronous functions to fetch weather data and store it on the local server.
* Establish a function that dynamically updates the user interface with the retrieved data.
